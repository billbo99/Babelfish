  Bugfixes:
    - Added a blacklist feature and added "dummy-steel-axe" as one of the entries.  this item does not have a locale to translate.    I think this was caused by 1.1.73,  I am reading it might be fixed in the near future.

Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2022.08.16
  Changes:
    - First release
    - Coverts all requested locales into one language so that I can use them with some of my mods.  After translations have been completed a custom event gets triggered that my other mods can then use a remote interface to download the translated locales.
